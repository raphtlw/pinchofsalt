## About

Many recipe websites are filled with ads, trackers, and popups. This project aims to combat that by being a fully open source recipe website that anyone can contribute to, in terms of recipes, content and the website itself. There is no JavaScript in the website at all and will never have it. Instead, the website is statically generated by a custom generator located in [/generator](./generator/). The website loads almost instantly too, which is a huge bonus.

## Directory structure

Recipes are located in [/src/recipes](./src/recipes) and all the source html files are located in [/src]. For more information about the directory or file structure, see the [contributing](https://[url-here]) docs.

## Contributing
