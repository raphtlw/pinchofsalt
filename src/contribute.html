            Recipes are written in Markdown format, a simple and easy text
            format. You can learn more about markdown
            <a
              href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet"

          </p>
          <p>
            When a new recipe is added, the catalog needs to be modified too.
            So, after creating a folder in the recipes directory with a rough
            but representative name of the recipe, create a file named
            "index.md". All the recipe content goes in that file. Assets go in
            the same folder too, so if you need to place any images for the
            recipe, just put them in the same folder as the recipe.
          </p>
          <p>A recipe has to be submitted in the following format:</p>
          <code>
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 mt-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
---
title: (The name of the recipe)
category: (The category or type of recipe)
preview: (The path to the image that is shown before the recipe)
dirname: (The name of the folder of the recipe that you are adding)
---
