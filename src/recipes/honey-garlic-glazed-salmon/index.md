# Honey Garlic Glazed Salmon

Searing fish might seem intimidating, but once you get the hang of it, it'll be second nature! It's important that you get your pan hot and the bottom of your pan thoroughly coated in oil. Place your filets skin side-up â€” you should hear a sizzle. Let the fillets cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes. (That's how you get that delicious crust!) Gently lift a corner of one fillet with a spatula. If it releases easily, it's ready to go. If not, give it a little more time. Flip, cook a few more minutes to get the skin crisp and the fish cooked through, and you're good to go!

## Ingredients

- 1/3 c. honey
- 1/4 c. soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 tsp. red pepper flakes
- 3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 4 6-oz. salmon fillets, patted dry with a paper towel
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lemon, sliced into rounds

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, lemon juice and red pepper flakes.
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat two tablespoons oil. When oil is hot but not smoking, add salmon skin-side up and season with salt and pepper. Cook salmon until deeply golden, about 6 minutes, then flip over and add remaining tablespoon of oil.
3. Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the honey mixture and sliced lemons and cook until sauce is reduced by about 1/3. Baste salmon with the sauce.
4. Garnish with sliced lemon and serve.
