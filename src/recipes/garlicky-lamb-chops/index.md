# Garlicky Lamb Chops

When you need a super fast weeknight dinner, lamb chops are the way to go. They are quick to make and just as easy as pork chops! And these are amped up with the addition of fresh rosemary and garlic. What could be better? Be sure to let them rest at least 5 minutes before digging in, that way all those delicious juices will be locked into the meat, rather than dripping down your chin. ðŸ˜‰

## Ingredients

- 1/4 c. freshly chopped rosemary
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 lb. small lamb chops, trimmed of fat
- 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

## Directions

1. On a large plate, combine rosemary and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Press lamb chops into mixture and set aside.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Working in batches, cook lamb until nicely browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
